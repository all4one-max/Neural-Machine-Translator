# Note

In the repo you can see Procfile, it is there because I have had made an attempt to deploy the app on heroku. The slug size on heroku is
500 Mb and tensorflow 2.3.0 is itself around 300 Mb and model_colab.h5 is around 130 Mb, therefore i was unable to deploy it on heroku.
If someone figures out a way to deploy Deep learning model on heroku for free, do let me know. My final slug size was around 547 Mb.
